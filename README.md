# LaugnyFy

A Music app that allows you to play your favourite songs without Ads. It also happens to be completely free!

NOTE: 
LaugnyFy is still in BETA, if there are any major Bugs I would be happy if you would report them. I cant guarantee that everything will work flawless, wait once LaugnyFy is in Alpha.
